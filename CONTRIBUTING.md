## Materials Pages Configuration

All materials are stored in the directory [src/pages](https://github.com/WebPurple/learn/tree/master/src/pages). 

Site Navigation = structure in this directory (**If correctly describe files with materials**)

There are some options to configure page: 
- title
- templateKey
- order
- isNavRoot
- navTitle

### Page config example:

[link to the article](https://github.com/WebPurple/learn/blob/master/src/pages/dictionaries/html/10_html_comments.md)

```md
---
title: ÐšÐ¾Ð¼Ð¼ÐµÐ½Ñ‚Ð°Ñ€Ð¸Ð¸
templateKey: 'article-page'
order: 10
---
```

## what does each of the options mean

### title

**Required**

Page Title.
Also used as Page main Header

### templateKey 

**Required**

The Template that is used to render the page.

Generally you have to use **article-page** temlate - template of simple article 

Also there are **section-page** and **contents-page** templates. 

#### Examples

[section-page](https://github.com/ZeninZenin/WebPurple-learn/blob/master/src/pages/dictionaries/index.md)

[contents-page](https://github.com/ZeninZenin/WebPurple-learn/blob/master/src/pages/dictionaries/css/index.md)

### navTitle

If not defined, used **title**

![navTitle](contributing/navTitle.png)

### order

**Optional**

The number in order the page link should be displayed in navigation. 

You have to define this option if order is important

![order](contributing/order.png)

### isNavRoot

**Optional**

Defines root of navigation for all child links.

When navigation bar is being rendering on some page, it finds the closest parent link with **isNavroot: true** and shows navogation starting with it.

#### Example 

Navigation starts from `/dictionaries`. Not from `/`
